opengl notes
there is GPU ALU and opengl GPU ram
ALU      -> very wide instructions, slower clock cycles than cpu
GPU-RAM  -> mappped memory, or assigned memory

DMA controller -> instructions about mapping PC-RAM memory to GPU-ram using GPU's bus controller

GPU dosen't have any context about the HARD-DISK


Communicating with the gpu 
--------------------------

push buffer -> the instructions we send to the gpu in buffer, which the gpu will read and execute the instructions on the buffer.

Ring-Transition, Ring 0, Ring 1 (privilage level) (user has no priviliage)(but the kernel has all the privilage)

Rings of privilage ensures that it happens (driver code is ring 0)

KICKOFF (os signal?) -> start executing the pushbuffer in the graphics card
The push buffer format in the GPU is different in every graphics card, openg gl translates/construct it for us
