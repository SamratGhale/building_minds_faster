Why not implement chunks with just x and not x,y
Chunk/Level Border
Current level on game_state

Architectural game:

NOTE: Entity storage and simulation

Each entity has world_position and sim_positoin

one chunk/level has no collision and interaction with another chunk/level 
algorithm for simulation


TODO:
- needs architectural name
- png rendering
- Prototype layer
- entity storage (code already exists)(only for single level)
- player movement
- bitmap rendering
- world building
- level design
- sound?

- Final game
	- opengl integration
	- animation

for now camera position is 0,0 on chunk 0,0. Consider the coordinate system to be aligned center

the two types of positon:
	world_positin - it's a general position containing which tile it belongs to and it's position relative to the CENTER OF THE CHUNK/LEVEL
	V2 - it's relative to the camera

	this need not exist if the camera is descrete
	For now let's not make camera position continious

-png rendering
	watch and read handmade hero code to write code to DISPLAY png on the screen
